# Welcome!
This README will be completed soon. If you want to see my portfolio in very early stages of development check it out at:
[tjklint.github.io]([tjklint.github.io](https://tjklint.github.io/))

In the meantime, here's some information:
- The website will be built in React with TypeScript
- The theme will be space with purple accents.

Here at my commit conventions:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit
