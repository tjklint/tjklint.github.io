            My interests change greatly depending on my environment, but at the
            moment, I am most interested by

            My skillset is quite wide-ranged, I don't focus all too heavy on the
            frameworks/languages, I like to choose the best tools to get the
            best product as fast as possible. I'm a quick learner, especially in
            fast-paced environments where I'm able to hone skills on the fly to
            improve and deliver on time.
