            Hello! My name is <span className="purple-text">TJ Klint</span>, well, technically it's <i>Timothy</i> (our little secret). 
            Anyways, I'm a passionate developer with a love for coding and technology. Most recently, I am working as a <span className="purple-text">Software Developer at CSE </span>
            (Communications Security Establishment) and previously a Software Developer at Bell.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently <span className="purple-text"> studying at John Abbott College </span> 
            in my <span className="purple-text">third year</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests change greatly depending on my environment, but at the moment, I am most interested by  
            <span className="purple-text"> AI/ML, Ethical Hacking, and Fintech.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            My skillset is quite wide-ranged, I don't focus all too heavy on the frameworks/languages, I like to choose
            the best tools to get the best product as fast as possible. I'm a quick learner, especially in fast-paced environments
            where I'm able to hone skills on the fly to improve and deliver on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My love for tech goes beyond the classroom. Iâ€™m always eager to dive into the world of hackathons and tech conferences. 
            My passion for these events led me to join my favorite conference, <span className="purple-text">CUSEC</span>, as the <span className="purple-text">Director of Events in 2024</span>. This year, 
            I'm thrilled to be stepping up as <span className="purple-text">Co-Chair for 2025</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of tech, you'll typically find me playing hockey, golfing, listening/discovering some live music, using the oxford comma, 
            and travelling!
